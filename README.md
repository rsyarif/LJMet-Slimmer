# LJMet-Slimmer - implementing XCone in single lepton -  25 January, 2018. - Rizki

Code (step1.cc/.h) to slim LJMet trees. Built on ROOT's MakeClass.

To test: give input file name in testStep1.C, copy a relevant step1 onto step1.*

Run: root -l testStep1.C


Set up runCondorSlimmerJobs.py to run over LJMet files stored on Fermilab's EOS.

Run with submitSlimmerJobs.sh

Hadd output files with hadd.sh after setting up haddoutput.py
